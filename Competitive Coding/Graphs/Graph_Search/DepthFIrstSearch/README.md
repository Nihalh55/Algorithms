## Depth-first search (DFS)
 An algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. One starts at the root (selecting some arbitrary node as the root in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking

This is the algorithm for Depth First Search in a given graph.

* We take a starting vertex , and push all its adjacent vertexes in a stack.
* Now we pop an element from a stack and push all its vertexes in the stack , and we also mark down these vertexes as visited.
* After executing the code, we will get the vertex visited in a depth first manner.
