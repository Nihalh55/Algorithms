## Breadth-first search (BFS)
 An algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes first, before moving to the next level neighbours.

This is the algorithm for Breadth First Search in a given graph.

* We take a starting vertex , and push all its adjacent vertexes in a queue.
* Now we pop an element from a queue and push all its vertexes in the queue , and we also mark down these vertexes as visited.
* After executing the code, we will get the vertex visited in a breadth first manner.
